## Releasing Code

1. A release owner is delegated to follow the process below and work with the team to tie up any loose ends.  As of this writing, it's a volunteer chosen in our weekly team meeting.

1. The pre-flight checklist:

    1. Ensure there are no critical patches for this tag that haven't landed yet
    1. Ensure any previous point releases have been merged back into `master`
    1. Update the section in the [deployment doc][deployment-doc] for the Train you are tagging
    1. Ensure you have appropriate QA signoffs
       * Not applicable for `master` -> stage
    1. Ensure you don't have any modified files or code laying around before you start the tag

**The release script expects the git origin to be unchanged from the default.**  If you've modified your git remotes you will get confusing output here and might mess things up.  If in doubt, check out a new copy of FxA (eg. `git clone git@github.com:mozilla/fxa.git fxa.tagging` and do all your tagging there. Also check that `git config --list` shows `commit.gpgsign=true` so that any commits made are GPG signed. If this is not already set globally, run `git config --global commit.gpgsign true`.

1. Run [release.sh][release.sh] from the root of the repository.  Make sure there are no errors in the output.

1. Do some manual checks in the new train branch to make sure the generated tags are sane:

    1. Do the changelogs match expectations from `git log`?
    1. Have all the version strings been updated?
    1. Does the diff from `origin/master` (or `origin/train-xxx` if it’s a point release) look correct?
    1. Does the diff between the public and private tags look correct (`git diff private/master origin/master`)?

1. The release script will print some commands to run to push the public and private train branches to the remotes.  **It's best to copy and paste these so you don't mix them up.**

1. The release script will also print some URLs which you can use to open PRs to merge the train branches back to their respective master branches

1. Finally, the release script will print out a bug template.  Copy that template and open a deployment bug in bugzilla under `Cloud Services :: Operations: Deployment Requests` ([example][example-deployment-bug]). Remember to include:

    1. Notes from the deploy doc, particularly any server side changes that need to happen as part of this deployment.
    1. Links to the needs:qa labels on GitHub.
    1. Links to the release tags on GitHub.
    1. Links to pertinent changelogs.
    1. Links to Circle builds that push to DockerHub.

#### Operations staff will take it from there…
1. Ensure that any configuration changes noted in the deployment bug land in [cloudops-deployment][cloudops-deployment].

1. Run any outstanding database migrations.  These are applied automatically for `dev` and `stage` but are reviewed manually for production since we may need to take care with the changes to avoid slow queries.  The migrations should be included in the [deployment doc][deployment-doc].

1. Build fxa-auth, fxa-content, fxa-oauth, fxa-profile, fxa-verifier in stage on Jenkins using git commit from cloudops-deployment PR and docker images referenced in deploy bug

1. Ensure that TeamCity tests are passing

1. Request QA on stage

    1. If major issues are found, a new patch is made and we’re back to step 3, running `release.sh patch`

        1. This command assumes that the relevant commit has been merged into the appropriate train branch. It bumps the minor rev on the last tag it finds in the tree from HEAD, so also requires that you checkout the appropriate train branch locally.

1. Deploy fxa-* to production

1. Initial deployment bug is closed

## FAQ

### What if the merge messes up the changelog?

After merging but before pushing, you should check the changelog to make sure that the expected versions are listed and they're in the right order. If any are missing or the order is wrong, manually edit the changelog so that it makes sense, using the commit summaries from `git log --graph --oneline` to fill in any blanks as necessary.

Then `git add` those changes and squash them into the preceding merge commit using `git commit --amend`. Now you can push and the merged changelog will make sense.

### What happens if there are test conflicts?
Test conflicts are most likely from a recently landed issue in `master`. Typically we create a new branch, resolve conflicts there, and then merge that branch into `master`.

## Merging and Branching Strategies

### The Simplified Happy Path: A regular release

![A simplified merging diagram](assets/fxa-release1.png)

During a regular release, running `release.sh` will create an appropriately named branch, update a few files like the Changelogs, and create a tag.  The Release Owner will push the branch to github and open a pull request back to `master`.

An example of commands to run for a release are:
```bash
git checkout master
git pull
./release.sh
# Follow the instructions printed
```

### The Full Happy Path: A regular release

![The full merging diagram](assets/fxa-release2.png)

The first diagram described a simple release, and it's accurate, but it's not the full picture.  An `fxa-private` repository is also maintained for confidential or security patches.  `release.sh` will create a branch in `fxa-private` for every release, even if there aren't private patches to push.  More often than not, `fxa-private` is unneeded, however, be aware that some things live in `fxa-private` that will never land in the `fxa` repository like the customs server rules and some deployment scripts.

### A Patch Release

![A patch release diagram](assets/fxa-release4.png)

A patch release is used between official releases.  For example, a regression discovered midway through a sprint that can't wait for a normal release cycle would be pushed to production earlier through this process.

In the scenario above, a regular release happened and `v1.100.0` was tagged and pushed to production.  Later, to fix a regression, a patch was landed *directly on the branch* rather than on `master`.  `release.sh patch` was run and `v1.100.1` was tagged.  Four more commits landed on the branch and `release.sh patch` tagged a `v1.100.2`.  In this scenario there were two patch releases in addition to the regular release at the end of the sprint.

It's not in the diagram above, but `release.sh` is also updating the `fxa-private` branches.

An example of commands to run for a patch release are:
```bash
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout train-100
# Ensure the pull requests on GitHub have landed before you continue
git pull
git log  # Verify it looks like you expect
./release.sh patch
# Follow the instructions printed
```

### Another Option for a Patch Release

![A alternative patch release diagram](assets/fxa-release5.png)

An alternative to the Patch Release described above would be to use an additional branch.  This would allow you to test complex changes without affecting the current release branch.

In the scenario above, a regular release occurs.  Then it's determined that two patches which landed on master earlier in the cycle are critical to be live now.  They are cherry-picked to an uplift branch, tested, and then merged back to the regular release branch.  At that point `release.sh patch` will do the regular updates.

An example of commands to run for this option are:
```bash
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout train-100
git pull
git branch train-100-uplift
git checkout train-100-uplift
git cherry-pick <commit1>
git cherry-pick <commit2>
(repeat as needed)
git log  # Verify you picked what you wanted to
git push origin train-100-uplift
# On GitHub:
# 1) make a Pull Request for train-100-uplift to merge into train-100
# 2) Ask for review
# 3) Wait for CI to pass ✅
# 4) Merge the Pull Request
git checkout train-100
git pull
./release.sh patch
# Follow the instructions printed
```

Git is a flexible tool and there are other options if other scenarios arise.  Don't hesitate to get in touch with your team to talk through the best courses of action.

### A Security Release

![Diagram showing a security release](assets/fxa-release3.png)

A security release will make use of the `fxa-private` repository.  This diagram illustates a regular release happened as usual, but halfway through the sprint an important security patch needed to be pushed live.  The patch, in red above, lands on the current train branch of `fxa-private`.  Once it's been reviewed and passes tests, `release.sh patch` is run to generate the changelogs as usual.  Operations is involved at this point to deploy to production directly from `fxa-private` so the patch is never seen before it's live.

Once the fix is verified in production, the patch is cherry-picked back for `fxa`.
